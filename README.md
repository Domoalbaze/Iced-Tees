# Iced-Tees
This repository has been created for our Software Engineering 2 class project.
Our idea, Iced Tees, is a website/application that provides designers with a cheap software to be able to
design cool clothing articles.

The final product would have a social page for creating/viewing other user's posts, a trending page to view new design trends, 
tutorial videos on how to use the design environment, and a design environment that allows the customization of clothing
designs.

This repository is managed by Trevor Miller, Sami Albaze, and Xavier Espinoza.
